   <p class="virat bg-img">Virat Kohli born 5 November 1988 is an Indian international cricketer who plays Test and One Day International 
      (ODI) cricket for the Indian national team. A former captain in all formats, Kohli retired from Twenty20 International 
      (T20I) following India's win at the 2024 T20 World Cup. He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional unorthodox 
      right arm quick bowler. He represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Delhi in 
      domestic cricket. He holds the record as the highest run-scorer in IPL, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and stands
       as the fourth-highest in international cricket.[5] He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI 
       cricket and stands second in the list of most international centuries scored. Kohli is widely regarded as one of the 
       greatest batsmen of all time and the greatest batsman in the modern era.[citation needed] Kohli was a key member of 
       the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup and captained India 
       to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.[6]

      In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In 2015, he achieved the summit of 
      T20I rankings.[7] In 2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number
       one spot in all three formats of the game. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. In 2020, the 
       International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade.[8]
      
      Kohli has garnered 10 ICC Awards which is more than any player in International Cricket, making him the most 
      decorated player in International Cricket history. He won the ICC ODI Player of the Year award four times in 
      2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on
       two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, he became the first player to win both ICC ODI and Test 
       Player of the Year awards in the same year. Also, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three
       
       consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. Kohli has the second most and most 'Player of the Match' and 'Player of the Series
       ' awards to his name, respectively, in all three formats combined. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the 
       Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and India's highest sporting honour, the Khel Ratna Award, in 2018. 
      In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world.
